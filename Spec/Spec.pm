=head1 NAME

MacOSX::File::Spec - Access FFSpec structure

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use MacOSX::File::Spec;
  $spec = MacOSX::File::Spec->new($path);
  # or
  $spec = path2spec($path);
  # 
  vRefNum = $spec->vRefNum;
  parID   = $spec->parID;
  name    = $spec->name;
  ($vRefNum, $parID, $name) = $spec->as_array
  path    = $spec->path;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module allows you to access FSSpec structure, which is used to
locate files on MacOS.  Though MacOS X allows you to access any files
via path like any decent UNIX, you may still have to access files via
old-fasioned MacOS way so here is the module.

=item $spec = MacOSX::File::Spec->new($path);
=item $spec = path2spec($path)

Creates MacOSX::File::Spec object from which you can access members
within.
When any error occurs, undef is returned and $MacOS::File::OSErr is
set to nonzero.

=item $spec->vRefNum

Returns Volume Reference Number.  Its Unix equivalent would be
stat($path)->dev. 

=item $spec->parID

Returns Parent ID, or the Directory ID of the directory in which the
file resides.  Its Unix equivalent would be stat(dirname($path))->ino
but as you know, Unix does not allow you to access directly via
i-node.

=item $spec->name

Returns file name without path component.

=item ($vRefNum, $parID, $name) = $spec->as_array

Returns vRefNum, parID, and name all at once.

=item $spec->path

Returns the absolute path which is reconstructed via FSSpec.  Not
necessarily equal to $path when you constructed this object.  Could be
handy when you want an absolute path of a file which path you know
only relatively.

=head2 EXPORT

path2spec(), which is an alias of MacOSX::File::Spec->new();
